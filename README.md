Web Development :coffee:

I’m a web developer who is always learning. I'm passionate about technology and innovation, and my main motivation is to create amazing user experiences. With over two years of hands-on experience, I’ve been focusing on front-end and mobile development, combining creativity and attention to detail to build intuitive and responsive applications.

Beyond technology, I love connecting with people. I’m creative, communicative, and enjoy working in teams to bring ideas to life. Traveling is also one of my biggest passions exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and finding inspiration in every experience.

I’ve had the opportunity to be involved in projects from conception to implementation, developing landing pages, integrating APIs, and creating responsive interfaces. I always strive to understand users’ needs in order to deliver functional and efficient solutions. I also enjoy participating in bootcamps, as I believe they’re a great way to accelerate learning and connect with other professionals.

My goal is to keep growing as a developer and deepen my knowledge of modern technologies. In the short term, I aim to strengthen my skills in current frameworks and best development practices. In the long term, I hope to contribute to high-impact projects, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to create innovative solutions.
