Web Development :coffee:

About me
I am a web developer and I'm always learning. I am passionate about technology and innovation, and my main motivation is to create amazing experiences for users. With over two years of hands-on experience, I specialize in front-end and mobile development, combining creativity and attention to detail to build intuitive and responsive applications.

In addition to technology, I love connecting with people. I am creative, communicative, and enjoy working in teams to turn ideas into reality. Traveling is also one of my big passions: exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and finding inspiration in every experience.

I have had the opportunity to participate in projects from conception to implementation, developing landing pages, integrating APIs, and creating responsive interfaces. I always seek to understand the needs of users to provide functional and efficient solutions. I also love participating in bootcamps, as I believe they are a great opportunity to accelerate learning and connect with other professionals.

My goal is to continue improving my skills and deepen my knowledge of modern technologies. In the short term, I aim to strengthen my skills in current frameworks and best development practices. In the long term, I would like to specialize even more in front-end development and contribute to high-impact projects, working with multidisciplinary teams to create innovative solutions.

Technologies I use:
Languages & Frameworks: JavaScript, React, React Native, CSS, Node.js, Express

Databases: SQL, NoSQL

Tools & Practices: RESTful APIs, Scrum, Kanban, TDD, CI/CD

Other tools: Git, Figma

I am always looking to explore new technologies and improve my skills as a developer. I love receiving feedback to improve my code, so don't hesitate to leave suggestions for improvement!
